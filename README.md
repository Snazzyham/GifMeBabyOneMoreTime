## Gif Me Baby One More Time.

Yes, the name of this utility is a play on a Britney Spears song. No, I'm not sorry.   

## Usage

Create a file named `data.json`, replace the variables in `app.php`, and you should be good to go.
Running it is as simple as `php app.php`, as php is preinstalled on Mac OS X and some linux distro's.
On windows you'll have to install it first.
